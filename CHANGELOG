Version 2.9.7
=============

* Improved creation of documentation for all exported objects.

* Added new factory of MPS-encoded functions: `mps_sum_of_exponentials`
  and `mps_heaviside`.

* Introduced `QuantizedInterval` for regular intervals with `2**n` points.

* All MPS-encoded function factories now use `QuantizedInterval`.

* Introduced `InteractionGraph` to construct arbitrarily complex
  Hamiltonians into MPO or sparse matrix form.

* Extended the documentation to include missing functions.

* Now it is possible to multiply `A @ B` when `A` and `B` are either
  `MPO` or `MPOList`. This is not implemented for `MPOSum` to avoid
  exponential blowup of operators.

* Added `fourier_derivative_mpo` and `fourier_derivative` for QFT-based
  differentiation of functions.

* All derivative functions are in `seemps.analysis.derivatives`
  Module `seemps.analysis.finite_differences` has been removed.

* All derivative functions use a `QuantizedInterval`

* `smooth_finite_differences_mpo` has been renamed to `finite_differences_mpo`.

Fixes
-----
* `finite_differences_interpolation` now accepts an `order` parameter.
