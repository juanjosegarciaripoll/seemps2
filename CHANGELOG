Version 3.0.1
=============
* Rearchitected tests to always use preseeded RNG for better reproducibility.

* Simplified the PolynomialExpansion class hierarchy to allow for other
  expansions in the future.

* Environment variable SEEMPS_DEBUG determines the debug level in SeeMPS's
  routines. Now the logger outputs those messages to sys.stderr.

Version 3.0.0
=============

These are the changes with respect to the 2.*.* releases:

* Upgraded documentation.

* Rearchitected Cython core, with upgraded performance.

* SeeMPS is now installable via PyPI (`pip instal...`)

* The repository has been redesigned to comply with state-of-the-art
  package definitions and development with `uv`.

* Improved the engine to encode functions as MPS / MPO:
  - Reorganized the description of intervals, meshes and quantization
    spaces for functions.
  - Upgraded and broader set of exactly constructible functions.
  - Polynomial expansions over MPS / MPO representations of functions.
  - Broad battery of tensor cross interpolation algorithms for loading.

* Reorganized and improved MPO-based eigensolvers, which now include
  DMRG, Arnoldi, power method and gradient descent.

* Larger battery of solvers of linear systems: CGS, BICGS, GMRES and
  DMRG based solvers.

* Completed the set of time evolution algorithms with more implicit
  solvers (Crank-Nicolson, Radau), TDVP and Runge-Kutta solvers.

* Upgraded toolbox for function differentiation: finite differences
  and Fourier, are now supplemented by HDAF methods.

* Minor but important fixes: e.g., MPS/MPOs can be divided by scalars,
  matrix multiplication `@` between MPO and MPOList are possible.

* Rearchitected and extended the emulator of parameterized quantum
  circuits, including multiqubit evolution with Hamiltonians, QAOA-type
  variational circuits and other layers.

* The library has been tested in three works with applications in
  PDE solution, function encoding and large-scale simulation of hard
  stiff problems.
