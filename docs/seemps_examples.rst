In the directory `examples` of the library, we have created various Jupyter notebooks that solve canonical problems using the SeeMPS library tools, from computing ground states of many-body problems, to solving static and time-dependent partial differential equations.

- `Computation of a spin-1/2 model ground state using DMRG <https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/seemps2/blob/main/examples/DMRG.ipynb>`_.
- `Solution of a Hamiltonian PDE <https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/seemps2/blob/main/examples/PDE.ipynb>`_.
- `Function interpolation <https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/seemps2/blob/main/examples/Interpolation.ipynb>`_.
- `Function differentiation <https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/seemps2/blob/main/examples/Differentiation.ipynb>`_.
- `Function integration <https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/seemps2/blob/main/examples/Integration.ipynb>`_.
- `Function optimization <https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/seemps2/blob/main/examples/Optimization.ipynb>`_.
- `Function loading with Chebyshev expansions <https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/seemps2/blob/main/examples/Chebyshev.ipynb>`_.
- `Function loading with TT-Cross <https://github.com/juanjosegarciaripoll/seemps2/blob/main/examples/TT-Cross.ipynb>`_.


Further examples of use appear in the datasets and associated codes to the following publications:
