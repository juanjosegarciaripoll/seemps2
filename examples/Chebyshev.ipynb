    "This notebook shows how to compose univariate functions with generic matrix product states using expansions of MPS in basis of orthogonal polynomials. In particular, we employ Chebyshev approximations. This algorithm can be used to load smooth univariate functions, as well as multivariate functions whose algebraic structure is given by univariate function composition. The main idea is that a Chebyshev expansion\n",

In practice it is more efficient to use the Clenshaw summation method, which evaluates the partial sum in a more efficient manner and does not require to compute the polynomials $T_k(x)$ separately."
