    "This notebook shows how to integrate functions loaded in MPS by contracting them with predefined quadrature MPS. These quadrature MPS can be straightforwardly generalized to multivariate scenarios by means of tensor products in both qubit orders, either serial or interleaved. Moreover, this integration procedure avoids the *curse of dimensionality*, as it has a cost that scales polynomially with the dimension of the function instead than exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main prerequisite for this *quantum-inspired* integration method is to dispose of a prior multivariate function loaded in MPS. This can be done following several methods, such as MPS orthogonal-polynomial expansions (see the `chebyshev_composition.ipynb` example), tensor cross-interpolation (TCI, see the `tt-cross.ipynb` example), multiscale interpolative constructions, solutions to partial differential equations, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we are going to load a trivially simple multivariate function \n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x_1, \\ldots, x_{10}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{10} x_i^3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integral of this function in $\\Omega = [-1, 1] \\times \\ldots \\times [-1, 1]$ is naively zero. Even though it can be analytically constructed, we use tensor cross-interpolation as it generalizes to a wider range of functions. Then, we integrate it following a Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rule."

In practice, TCI proves to be accurate and robust for encoding these types of MPS in most situations.\n",

This example illustrates the generality of TCI and MPS-based integration."
