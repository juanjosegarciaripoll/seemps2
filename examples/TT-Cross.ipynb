    "## Loading black-box functions with TT-Cross\n",
    "\n",
    "TT-Cross, also known as tensor cross-interpolation (TCI), is a method to load black-box functions in tensor trains or MPS. This library implements several variants of TT-Cross, each with its advantages and drawbacks. In this example, we show the usage of the DMRG-based variant `cross_DMRG`, however, these examples apply analogously to all other variants by just replacing the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The black-box function given as input corresponds to a `BlackBox` object. There are several subclasses corresponding to different input black-boxes, applicable in different scenarios. In this notebook, we show a brief example for each type."

    "This black-box representation allows to load functions in a MPS/TT with any structure. The quantization of the degrees of freedom in MPS cores, as well as their order in the MPS, is set by a linear transformation known as the `map_matrix`. This is a matrix that maps between the MPS indices and the integer coordinates of the `Mesh` indexing the function values on its multivariate domain. Some possibilities involve, for example, quantizing the degrees of freedom in different tensor orders, such as *serial (A)* and *interleaved (B)*. \n",
